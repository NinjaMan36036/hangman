You are to create a simple hangman game

At the beginning of the game, the user is asked what category he wants to use for the game. The options are:

Baby Animals

A word is randomly selected from the category selected, and the user is told how long the word is.

The user then selects the difficulty level (Easy, Normal, or hard). At the hard level, the user is only allowed three mistakes, Normal: five, and Easy: seven. 
The user can try a letter.

If the letter does not exist in the word, the user loses a life and figure 1 is displayed (See example outputPreview the document). 

If the letter exists, the user is shown where the letter is in the word (example: if the user picks g and the word is Georgia, the display would be g---g--. The user is then asked if they want to guess the word. They can pass, or try to guess. If they guess incorrectly, they lose a life and figure 1 is displayed. If they guess correctly, the game is over.

The above process is repeated. Every time they guess wrong, they get the next figure (figure 2, then 3, and so).

If they guess wrong five times (or 3 or 7 depending on the level), they lose, and the game exits and displays the word.

After each game, the user is asked if he wants to play again.
